A response from Rabbi Glasner which appeared in the
CALIFORNIA JEWISH PRESS--AN INDEPENDENT PAPER
Los Angeles, February 1, 1967
</pre>
<h2>JEWISH FEDERATION-COUNCIL CHARGED WITH DICTATOR ROLE</h2>
<h5>Rabbi Juda Glasner, Vice President of United Orthodox Rabbinate
of Greater Los Angeles, and member of the Interfaith Committee for
Released Time Religious instruction issued the following
statement:</h5>
<p>"It is most deplorable that the Community Relations Committee of
the Jewish Federation-Council of Greater Loa Angeles and the Board
of Rabbis chose to embark upon a policy which infringes upon the
equal rights of a segment of our Jewish community.</p>
<p>This has been evidenced by the recent statement of January 13,
1967, in which the CRC and the Jewish Federation Council and the
Board of Rabbis state their position concerning the Released Time
Religious Instruction Program with particular emphasis that only
they can speak for the "Organized Jewish Community."</p>
<p>It continues: "A little better than a year ago, Rabbi Levy ,
advised Father Hugh Clear, Chairman of the Los Angeles Interfaith
Committee on Released Time Religious Instruction, that: "We have
been under the impression that this matter has been settled insofar
as the organized Jewish community is concerned. since we have gone
on record many times opposing participation in the Released Time
project of the public schools system in Los Angeles."</p>
<p>The position taken by the CRC and the Board of Rabbis is
tantamount to a denial of the equal rights guaranteed to all under
the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p>"In our opinion this is a serious development In our free
society when an organization makes the attempt to regiment the
thinking of the Jewish community and to say that we are the only
ones who have the right to speak for the Jewish community and no
others can raise their voice because they differ and are
different."</p>
<p>We believe that it is time to remind the CRC of the Jewish
Federation-Council and the Board of Rabbis that the position they
are taking Is alien to the American and Jewish way of life.</p>
<p>It might be well to refresh our memories as to the words of
Thomas Jefferson: "That the minority possess their equal right
which equal law must protect, and to violate would be
oppression."</p>
<p>It seems to be a paradoxical phenomena that those who constantly
speak for civil rights are violating the rights of the minority
within the minority and say we are the masters of the Jewish
community and consequently Released Time, for example, is out.</p>
<p>The Jewish Federation-Council tries to conceal their untenable
position by referring to bigness and numbers of organizations that
they represent. We are not arguing the point of their bigness, but
we just want to remind them that their bigness can not discourage
the minority in pursuing those goals which we believe are right and
just. On the other hand, we don't expect them to abandon the
objectives which they believe to be right and just.</p>
<p>We take exception to the statement made by the Community
Relations Committee and the Bureau of Jewish Education that they
will continue to provide Jewish education throughout Greater Los
Angeles.</p>
<p>The fact is that neither the Board of Rabbis nor the Bureau of
Jewish Education or the CRC for the Jewish Federation-Council was
able to provide Jewish education for the 80 children who were
enrolled in the Released Time Program in the Laurel School and in
other districts.</p>
<p>Too many children hove been forgotten and abandoned by the Board
of Rabbis and the Jewish Federation-Council to justify their
opposition against the Released Time Religious Instruction
Program.</p>
